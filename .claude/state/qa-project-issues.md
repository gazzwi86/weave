# QA project-level escalation queue

Per Law #11 (aggregation rule): once the same recommendation appears in two consecutive
QA reports, it is escalated here (severity `Project`) and stops being repeated in
per-task reports.

## PROJ-001: Progress-summary section headers don't match the spec-template's literal names

- **Title:** Engineer progress summaries use ad-hoc section headers (e.g. "Decisions /
  deviations from the brief", "Notes for QA") instead of `.claude/spec-templates/progress-summary.md`'s
  literal `Decisions Made` / `Assumptions Made` headers.
- **Severity:** Project
- **Raised in tasks:** PLAT-TASK-001 (QA report, as a per-task recommendation — not yet
  escalated at the time), PLAT-TASK-002 (QA report — same gap recurs, escalating now per
  Law #11 instead of repeating it a third time).
- **Evidence:** `.claude/state/summaries/PLAT-TASK-001.md` and
  `.claude/state/summaries/TASK-002.md` both carry substantively-equivalent content
  (assumptions/decisions are documented) under non-matching headers, so this is a
  naming/tooling-greppability gap, not a content gap — the QA preflight check in both
  cases passed on substance.
- **Owner:** Engineer persona (applies the template), enforced by Scaffold-phase (should
  bake the literal headers into whatever scaffolds new task progress-summary files).
- **Deadline:** Before the next task's progress summary is written (PLAT-TASK-003 or
  whichever task is next in the implement loop) — this is a near-zero-cost fix (rename
  two headers) and should not reach a third occurrence.
